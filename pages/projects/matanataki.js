                    and that of their environment.

                <p className='my-4'>

                    an innovative platform.

                <h3 className='mt-10 sm:mt-16 mb-4 text-2xl font-medium text-green-800 text-center italic'>Sprint 1: Low Fidelity</h3>
                <p className='my-4'>
                    In our first sprint, our goal was to <b className='text-green-800'> gain maximum feedback</b> to provide future design direction.
                    To quickly generate ideas and to encourage honest feedback, we completed our designs in <b className='text-green-800'>low fidelity</b>,
                    which means they were akin to rough sketches to focus on layout rather than visual details.
                    <i> This is not our final design</i>.</p>
                <p className='my-4'>
                    To create our first rough, clickable prototype, we used the Impakt Figma Template Design System,
                    which includes various components that mimic sketched prototypes. After showing designs to two potential users
                    (both business owners of local companies in Fiji) in our usability tests, we incorporated their insights into the second-stage designs.               </p>

                <h3 className='mt-12 sm:mt-16 mb-4 text-xl font-medium text-green-800'>low fidelity prototypes for usability walkthrough</h3>
                <p className='my-4'>
                    For the <b className='text-green-800'>Waste Streams Dashboard</b>, we created an intuitive scrollable home screen that allows
                    users to pick the type of waste they would like to dispose of. From there, users can see educational information about
                    the type of waste that they are disposing of, as well as the options they have for disposal.
                </p>
                <p className='my-4'>
                    For the <b className='text-green-800'>Waste Pickup Scheduler</b>, we designed a straightforward flow for our users, allowing them
                    to provide the necessary customizations and information for a successful pickup. Through usability tests, we hoped to see if the flow
                    felt natural for our users, and if there was any part that felt confusing or missing.
                </p>
                <p className='my-4'>
                    The <b className='text-green-800'>Personal Payment History Dashboard</b> was designed around the idea of being able to “sort
                    by” different categories of waste payments: action, schedule type, waste type, provider, payment
                    status, order status, and schedule date — with totals over each subcategory.
                </p>
                <p className='my-4'>
                    The <b className='text-green-800'>Impact Profile</b> needed to serve two main purposes: to give users a place to set important
                    user profile-related information (name, photo, council, payment) and to view sustainability impact
                    statistics. Two screens were designed for the impact statistics: a flashier, shareable summary
                    page, and more in-depth, progress-tracking details page.

                    In that session, we walked through the prototype using the following interview procedure:
